## Unit 1: Design Thinking (The "Coffee Shop" Analogy)

### The Problem
You want to open a new coffee shop.

#### 1. Traditional Method (Not Design Thinking)
*   **Action:** You rent a place, buy the most expensive coffee machine, and put "Best Coffee" on the sign.
*   **Result:** Nobody comes. Why? Maybe people in that area prefer Tea. You failed because you started with the *Solution*, not the *User*.

#### 2. Design Thinking Method (The 5 Steps)
1.  **Empathise:** You stand on the street corner and talk to people. You realize they are all rushing to office and don't have time to sit.
2.  **Define:** "People need a quick caffeine boost, not a relaxing lounge experience."
3.  **Ideate:** What if we sell coffee through a window? What if we do a subscription model? What if we sell energy bars instead?
4.  **Prototype:** You set up a simple table with a thermos and sell coffee for one day to see what happens.
5.  **Test:** You learn that people hate the paper cups because they spill. So you iterate and get better lids.

## Unit 2: Agile vs Waterfall (The "Building Construction" vs "Painting" Analogy)

### Waterfall = Building a House
*   **Planning:** You need the full blueprint before you lay a single brick.
*   **Execution:** You pour the foundation, then walls, then roof.
*   **The Issue:** If the owner comes halfway through and says, "Actually, I want the kitchen on the second floor," it's impossible. You have to destroy everything and start over.
*   *Conclusion:* Good for predictable things, bad for changing requirements.

### Agile = Painting a Portrait
*   **Iteration 1:** You sketch a rough outline. You ask the customer: "Is the pose okay?"
*   **Iteration 2:** You add base colors. Customer says: "Make the eyes bluer." You change it easily.
*   **Iteration 3:** You add details. Customer says: "Add a hat." You add it.
*   **The Benefit:** The customer sees the painting evolve and gives feedback *while* you are working. The final result is exactly what they wanted, even if they didn't know it at the start.

## Scrum Concepts (The "Road Trip" Analogy)

*   **Product Owner (Navigator):** Holds the map. Decides *where* we are going (Goal).
*   **Scrum Team (Driver & Passengers):** They actually drive the car. They decide *how* to drive (Speed, Route).
*   **Scrum Master (Mechanic/Guide):** Fixes the flat tire (Remove Blockers) and ensures everyone follows road safety rules (Scrum Process).
*   **The Sprint:** A "leg" of the journey. You don't drive 2000km at once. You drive for 4 hours (Sprint), stop, check the map (Review), and adjust the route if there is traffic (Retrospective).
